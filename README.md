Which packages are available already for Meta-analysis in R and how are they inter-related? Using R functions to develop a dependency network we show that there are currently 95 R packages on CRAN that are focused on meta-analysis and 546 "supporting" packages that underpin functions in the meta-analysis packages. We then use thematic analysis to identify clusters of meta-analysis packages that (based on their description) carry out similar functions.
